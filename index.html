            <p>
                An Angus burger is a hamburger made using beef from Angus cattle. The name Angus burger is used by several fast-food hamburger chains for one or more "premium" burgers; however, it does not belong to any single company. Pre-made frozen Angus burgers are increasingly available from retailers.
